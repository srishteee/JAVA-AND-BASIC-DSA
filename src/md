How would you sort a list of objects that are already sorted by one attribute but you want to sort them by another attribute?

You can use a Comparator to sort the list by the new attribute. If the list is already sorted by one attribute,
using a secondary sorting strategy (e.g., using thenComparing) can maintain the previous order where applicable.

How to handle null values when implementing compare methods.
We can use Comparator.nullsFirst() or Comparator.nullsLast() to define how null values should be treated.
Here are examples for both approaches.


number system
decimal -> base 10
binary -> base 2
octal -> base 8
hexadecimal -> base 16
conversions
b->d->h
